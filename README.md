# Install
./comp.x in autofit/src

For pyfit wrapper input generator:
   Mako Templates module for Python is required

# Input Files
## Fortran input file
The Fortran input file contains a series of records, each a single line of input parameters (see example fit.in files)
Alternatively, input can be formatted in more user-friendly file and converted with accompanying Python wrapper (located in /pyfit)
Below are listed each record and associated parameters, with data type in parantheses

Record 1: EnergyRanges
cut0 cut1 cut2 cut3 (dp)
-Values of energy ranges in kcal/mol with cut0 > cut1 > cut2 > cut3

Record 2: Epsilon
epsilon (dp)
-Range parameter in kcal/mol for the weight function (see )

Record 3: BatchZeroes
z1 z2 z3 (dp)
-Sets the "zeroes" for the weight function for reactant, product, and saddle point (R,P,SP) batches

Record 4: BatchWeights
w1 w2 w3 (dp)
-Sets the relative weights for each batch (R,P,SP) -- leave as 1 1 1 for default weighting

Record 5: NumAtoms
natom (int)
-Number of atoms in system

Record 6: AtomGroups
iagroup(natom) (int)
-Atom group of each atom

Record 7: Symbols
symb(natom) (char * 2)
-Atom symbol for each atom

Record 8: FactorOrder, TotalOrder
ipow ipowt (int)
-Maximum allowed order for each factor and total order of the term

Record 9: ReadBasis
lreadbasis (logical)
    = TRUE, read basis from basis.dat
    = FALSE, compute basis and write to basis.dat

Record 10: FindDisconnected
lreaddisc (logical)
    = TRUE, determine disconnected atom groups to remove from basis
    = FALSE, do not consider disconnected groups

if lreaddisc=TRUE:
    Record 11: DisconnectedGroups
        dgroup(natom) (int)
        -Atom groups of bond type to monitor for disconnected terms - can differ from Record 6 (AtomGroups) if specific bonds should be maintained

    Record 12: MonitorGroups
        dg1 dg2 (int)
        -Atom groups of bonds to monitor
